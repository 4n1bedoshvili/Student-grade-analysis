This is a simple program to Analyze a list of student with unique names and their test scores to extract useful information such as unique grades, top performers, and students who failed.

I have three functions.

Second Identifies and prints the names of the top three students with the highest scores.

With the third function,you can dentify and print the names of students who scored below 51, along with their scores.
